There are a couple of things that bother me (the creator) about this prototype site. 

Number 1, I don't remember how to do media queries, so the 
screen looks awful on mobile sized displays.

Number 2, Youtube has copyrighted the music so that it cannot be embedded into this site. I have personally purchased
all of The Killers songs to listen to on iTunes, and store a copy of the mp3 files on my computer, but will not
be putting a copy on gitHub due to copyright restrictions. The goal is to promote the band, not hurt them.

Number 3, I don't know how to toggle classes with a script yet, so the menu button and play buttons are pretty much static at the moment.
In the future, I'd like to make play toggle with pause on click, and add a menu that contains different links to the Killers real site.

Issues 1 and 3 will be resolved at some point, but issue 2 is a permanent issue. A fully functioning version of this site is not feasible
due to copyright. However, I am pleased enough with the design and concept for my first website. And the display is
responsive and dynamic to within approx 1/2 the width of a full desktop frame.

Edit: I got the local version fully functional. Can play songs and change classes for play/pause button.
